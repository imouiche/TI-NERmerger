Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China S-LOC
's O
cyber B-APT
threat I-APT
actors E-APT
. O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
said O
it O
has O
tracked O
admin@338 S-APT
's O
activity S-ACT
since O
2013 S-TIME
and O
the O
group S-APT
has O
largely O
targeted O
organizations S-IDTY
involved O
in O
financial B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
economic I-IDTY
, I-IDTY
and I-IDTY
trade I-IDTY
policy E-IDTY
. O

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
operating O
in O
China S-LOC
, O
and O
most O
likely O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC
. O

These O
data O
sets O
show O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
either O
operating O
in O
China S-LOC
during O
normal O
Chinese S-LOC
business O
hours O
or O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
intentionally O
going O
to O
painstaking O
lengths O
to O
look O
like O
they O
are O
. O

APT1 S-APT
has O
used O
and O
steadily O
modified O
BISCUIT S-MAL
since O
as O
early O
as O
2007 S-TIME
and O
continues O
to O
use O
it O
presently O
. O

While O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly B-MAL
available I-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
such O
as O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL
and O
Gh0st B-MAL

Given O
the O
mission O
, O
resourcing O
, O
and O
location O
of O
PLA B-APT
Unit I-APT
61398 E-APT
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
PLA B-APT
Unit I-APT
61398 E-APT
is O
APT1 S-APT
. O

APT1 S-APT
were O
a O
highly O
prolific O
cyber-attack B-APT

operating O
out O
of O
China S-LOC

APT1 S-APT

a O
China-based S-LOC
cyber-espionage B-APT
group E-APT

active O
since O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
APT12 S-APT

a O
modified O

that O
we O
call O
HIGHTIDE S-MAL

However O
, O
the O
malware O
shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE S-MAL
and O
HIGHTIDE B-TOOL
backdoor E-MAL
that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 S-APT
. O

From O
October B-TIME
2012 E-TIME
to O
May B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
observed O

FireEye S-SECTEAM

, O
three O

clearly O
reflects O
areas O

an O
Eastern B-LOC

most O

the O

We O
identified O
three O
themes O
in O
APT28 S-APT

which O
together O
are O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
the O
Russian S-LOC

Georgian O
military O
security O
issues O
, O
particularly O
with O
regard O
to O
U.S. S-LOC
cooperation O

NATO S-IDTY

provide O
a O
strong O

Russian S-LOC

actors E-APT
to O
steal S-ACT

we O
observed O
the O

engage O
separately O
in O
the O

APT28 S-APT

We O
believe O
that O
APT28 S-APT

the O
MOD O
aligns O
with O

We O
assess O
that O

most O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
a O
well-resourced O
, O
highly O
dedicated O
and O
organized O
cyberespionage B-APT
group E-APT
that O
we O
believe O
has O
been O
working O

since O
at O
least O
2008 S-TIME
to O
collect S-ACT
intelligence S-IDTY
in O
support O
of O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O
decision-making O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
CozyDuke S-MAL
, O
CloudDuke S-MAL
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
, O
HammerDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke S-MAL
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs E-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke S-MAL
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-MAL
malware E-MAL
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group S-APT
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
thus O
the O
threat B-APT
actor E-APT
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes S-APT
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign S-ACT
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-TOOL
samples E-MAL
discovered O
from O
2009 S-TIME
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense E-IDTY
of O
Georgia O
and O
the O
ministries B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
foreign I-IDTY
affairs E-IDTY
of O
Turkey S-LOC
and O
Uganda S-LOC
. O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
trojan I-MAL
samples E-MAL
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign S-ACT
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
MiniDuke S-MAL
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 S-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes S-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian S-LOC
threat B-APT
actors E-APT
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT
Storm E-ACT
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine S-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine S-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia S-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia S-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine S-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
however O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
and O
HammerDuke S-MAL
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
of O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
and O
CosmicDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
in O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
again O
the O
group S-APT
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns S-ACT
with O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
CloudDuke S-MAL
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert B-ACT
, I-ACT
surgical I-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
using O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation S-ACT
of O
CVE-2013-0640 S-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke S-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day S-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group S-APT
acquired O
the O
exploit O
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group S-APT
operates O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Russian S-LOC
Federation O
. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O
zone O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
timestamps O
found O
in O
many O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
samples E-MAL
, O
which O
similarly O
suggest O
the O
group S-APT
work O
in O
the O
Moscow O
Standard O
Time O
timezone O
, O
as O
further O
detailed O
in O
the O
section O
on O
the O
technical O
analysis O
of O

that O
we O
call O
POSHSPY S-MAL

Mandiant S-SECTEAM
has O
since O
identified O
POSHSPY S-MAL
in O
several O
other O
environments O
compromised O
by O
APT29 S-APT
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

In O
the O
investigations O
Mandiant S-SECTEAM
has O
conducted O
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
APT29 S-APT
deployed O
POSHSPY S-MAL
as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
for O
use O
if O
they O
lost O
access O
to O
their O
primary O

POSHSPY S-MAL

an O
excellent O

APT38 S-APT

We O
consider O

operations O
more O
global O

highly O

APT38 S-APT
is O
a O
financially B-ACT
motivated E-ACT
group S-APT
linked O

North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
cyber B-APT
espionage I-APT

hundreds I-ACT

of I-IDTY
dollars E-ACT
from O

their O
brazen O
use O
of O

. O

Because O
APT38 S-APT
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O

of O
) O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
group S-APT

an O
" O

instead O
of O
a O

Over O

as O

TTPs O

almost O

indicating O
that O

made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational B-APT

primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O

resources O
and O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
state O
sponsorship O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity S-ACT
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 S-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise B-ACT
large I-ACT
sums I-ACT
of I-IDTY
money E-ACT
for O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 S-TIME
, O
APT38 S-APT
has O
attempted O
to O
steal S-ACT
hundreds I-ACT
of I-IDTY
millions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
dollars E-ACT
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
. O

APT38 S-APT
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks S-IDTY
and O
financial B-IDTY
entities E-IDTY
since O
at O
least O
2014 S-TIME
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks S-IDTY
, O
media S-IDTY
, O
and O
government B-IDTY
agencies E-IDTY
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 S-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 S-APT
targeted O
news B-IDTY
outlets E-IDTY
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial B-IDTY
sector E-IDTY
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
. O

APT38 S-APT
also O
targeted O
financial B-IDTY
transaction I-IDTY
exchange I-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks S-IDTY
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT
and O
the O
heist B-ACT
activity E-ACT
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups S-APT
under O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O
associated O
with O
reconnaissance S-ACT
( O
TEMP.Hermit S-APT
or O
a O
related O
group S-APT
) O
and O
another O
for O
the O
heists O
( O
APT38 S-APT
) O
. O

APT38 S-APT
, O
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT S-TOOL
fraud O
to O
steal S-ACT
millions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
dollars E-ACT
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-ACT
operator I-ACT
activity E-ACT
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O
, O
including O
motivation O

malware O

TTPs O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
statesponsored O
operations O

As O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
APT38 S-APT
's O
mission O
is O
focused O
on O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
to O
raise B-ACT

While O
North B-LOC

may O
have O
been O
driven O

the O

probably O
contributed O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
APT38 S-APT

APT38 S-APT

operations S-ACT

in O
February B-TIME

We O
do O
not O

This O

in O
late B-TIME

APT38 S-APT
relies O
on O
DYEPACK S-MAL

to O
initiate O

, O
steal S-ACT

In O
all O

the O
Lazarus S-APT
utilized O
similar O
toolsets O

including O
KillDisk S-MAL
that O
was O
executed O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk B-MAL
malware E-MAL
was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus S-APT
, O
rather O
than O
by O
another O

unrelated O
attacker S-APT

This O
recent O
attack S-ACT
against O
an O
online O

Central B-LOC

suggests O
that O
hacking S-ACT
tools O
from O
the O

are O
recompiled O
with O
every O
attack S-ACT
( O
we O
didn't O
see O
these O
exact O
samples O
anywhere O
else O
) O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk S-MAL
in O
the O
attack S-ACT
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers S-APT
covering B-ACT
their I-ACT
tracks E-ACT
after O
an O
espionage S-ACT

or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O
extortion S-ACT
or O
cyber-sabotage S-APT
. O

Today O
we'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
findings O
, O
and O
add O
something O
new O
to O
what O
's O
currently O
common O
knowledge O
about O
Lazarus B-ACT
Group I-ACT
activities E-ACT
, O
and O
their O
connection O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
attacker S-APT
attempted O
to O
steal S-ACT
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh B-IDTY
Central I-IDTY
Bank E-IDTY
. O

Since O
the O
Bangladesh S-LOC
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
and O
the O
Bangladesh S-LOC
bank S-IDTY
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus S-APT
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks S-IDTY
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus S-APT
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland S-LOC
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers S-IDTY
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media S-IDTY
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers S-APT
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus S-APT
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus S-APT
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks S-IDTY
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks S-ACT
on O
banks S-IDTY
to O
Lazarus S-APT
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker S-APT
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack S-ACT
in O
Europe S-LOC
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O

Lazarus B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group S-APT
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus S-APT
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-ACT
and I-ACT
cybersabotage I-ACT
activities E-ACT
, O
such O
as O
attacks S-ACT
on O
Sony B-IDTY
Pictures I-IDTY
Entertainment E-IDTY
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage B-ACT
operations E-ACT
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group S-APT
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff S-APT
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus S-APT
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks S-IDTY
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
group E-APT
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus S-APT
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking B-IDTY
sector E-IDTY
, O
finance S-IDTY
, O
and O
trading B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos S-IDTY
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus S-APT
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
attack E-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
2016 E-TIME
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
campaign E-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME

after O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
provides O
keylogging S-ACT
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
's O
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence B-ACT
functionality E-ACT
and O
the O
keylogging B-TOOL
functionality E-TOOL
. O

The O
persistence B-ACT
functionality E-ACT
of O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
uses O
compromised B-TOOL
infrastructure E-TOOL
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa S-MAL
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus S-APT
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
malware E-MAL
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL
and O
standalone B-TOOL
executable E-TOOL
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-MAL
installer E-MAL
is O
responsible O
for O
installing B-ACT
the I-ACT
service I-ACT
DLL I-ACT
variant E-ACT
. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
's O
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage S-APT
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious B-ACT
activity E-ACT
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting B-ACT
of I-IDTY
antivirus I-ACT
capabilities E-ACT
and O
the O
disabling B-ACT
of I-IDTY
firewalls E-ACT
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
very O
fundamental O
defensive O

about O
a O
cyber B-ACT
espionage I-ACT
attack E-ACT
using O
the O
Emissary B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
oldest O
sample O
we O
found O
was O
created O
in O
2009 S-TIME
, O
indicating O
this O
tool O
has O
been O
in O

all O
of O

they O
use O
themes O
related O
to O
the O

Of O
note O
, O
this O
is O
three O
years O
earlier O

we O
observed O

All O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
observations O
made O
during O
this O
analysis O
is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
development O
effort O
devoted O
to O
Emissary S-MAL
significantly O
increased O
after O
we O
published O
our O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary S-MAL
as O
early O
as O
2009 S-TIME
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat B-APT

have O
relied O
on O
this O
tool O
as O
a O
payload O
in O
cyber-espionage B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
for O
many O
years O
. O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O
advanced O
functionality O
like O

, O
it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
most O
tasks O
desired O
by O
threat B-APT

: O
exfiltration S-ACT

a O
much O
more O
rapid O

the O

that O

the O
targeting O

represent O

have O
, O
once O
APT10 S-APT

gained O
access O

it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O

move O

onto O
the O

of O
potentially O
thousands O

APT10 S-APT
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
post-2014 S-TIME
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL
to O
PlugX S-MAL
. O

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 S-APT
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP S-TOOL
, O
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs S-TOOL
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 S-APT
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential B-ACT
theft E-ACT
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz S-TOOL
or O
PwDump S-TOOL
, O
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-TOOL
load I-TOOL
order I-TOOL
hijacking E-TOOL
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 S-APT
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-TOOL
tasks E-TOOL
or O
Windows B-TOOL
services E-TOOL
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising S-ACT
high I-ACT
value I-ACT
domain I-ACT
controllers E-ACT
and O
security B-ACT
servers E-ACT
, O
the O
threat B-APT
actor E-APT
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 S-APT
used O
either O
a O
reverse B-TOOL
shell E-TOOL
or O
RDP S-PROT
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor S-APT
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab S-MAL
, O
and O
now O
ChChes S-MAL
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves S-MAL
) O
, O
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network S-IDTY
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 S-APT
use O
DLL B-ACT
search I-ACT
order I-ACT
hijacking I-ACT
and I-ACT
sideloading E-ACT
, O
to O
execute O
some O
modified O
versions O
of O
open-source O
tools O
. O

For O
example O
, O
PwC B-SECTEAM
UK E-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
APT10 S-APT
compiling O
DLLs O
out O
of O
tools O
, O
such O
as O

PwDump6 S-MAL
, O
and O
using O
legitimate O
, O

, O
such O
as O
Windows S-OS

to O
load O
the O
malicious O

. O

During O
our O
analysis O
of O
victim O
networks O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 S-APT
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O
cycle O
in O
late B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
. O

We O
observed O
the O
deployment O
and O
testing O
of O
multiple O

, O
and O
the O
introduction O

APT10 S-APT

a O
constantly O
evolving O

actor E-APT
that O
has O
an O
ambitious O

against O
a O
broad O

Since O

APT10 S-APT
has O
made O
a O
number O

An O

shows O
a O
clear O
evolution O
from O

that O
has O
been O

this O
is O
indicative O
of O
APT10 S-APT

which O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
continue O
. O

The O
threat B-APT

to O
that O
of O
other O

, O
which O
supports O
our O
assessment O
that O
these O
campaigns S-ACT
are O
conducted O
by O
APT10 S-APT
. O

APT10 S-APT
( O

a O
Chinese S-LOC

that O
FireEye S-SECTEAM

to O
the O
Moafee S-APT

Both O
Moafee S-APT

DragonOK S-APT
favor O
spear-phishing B-ACT

an O
attack S-ACT
vector O
, O
often O
employing O
a O

By O
targeting O

Security O

that O
targeted O
not O
just O
Israelis S-LOC

in O
Japan S-LOC

Taiwan S-LOC
. O

In O
2012 S-TIME
, O
the O
Molerats B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
appeared O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
the O
XtremeRAT S-MAL

a O
freely O
available O

that O
is O
popular O
with O
attackers S-APT
based O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
. O

But O
the O
group S-APT
has O
also O
used O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL
( O
PIVY S-MAL
) O
, O
a O
RAT S-MAL
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O
threat B-APT
actors E-APT
in O
China S-LOC
— O
so O
much O
so O
that O
PIVY S-MAL
has O
, O
inaccurately O
, O
become O
synonymous O
with O
all O
APT B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
linked O
to O
China S-LOC
. O

This O
blog O
post O
analyzes O
several O
recent O
Molerats B-ACT

that O
deployed O
PIVY S-MAL
against O

in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
and O
in O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
We O
also O
examine O
additional O
PIVY B-ACT

that O
leverage O
Arabic-language O

related O
to O
the O
ongoing O
crisis O
in O
Egypt S-LOC
and O
the O
wider O
Middle B-LOC

into O
opening O
malicious B-FILE

We O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
using O
PIVY S-MAL
is O
an O
attempt O
by O
those O
behind O
the O
Molerats B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
to O
frame O
China-based S-LOC
threat B-APT
actors E-APT
for O

A O

what O
the O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
worrying O
discovery O
we O
made O
was O
that O
Thrip O
had O
targeted O
a O
satellite B-IDTY

Thrip O
seemed O
to O
be O
mainly O
interested O
in O
the O

This O
suggests O
to O
us O
that O

motives O
go O

may O
also O
include O

cases O

Venomous B-APT

has O
deployed O
malware O
to O

using O
several O
novel B-ACT
methods E-ACT
. O

For O
years O
, O
Turla S-APT

relied O

among O
other O
impersonations O
, O
on O
fake B-TOOL

Turla S-APT
merely O
uses O
the O
Adobe O

trick O
users O

By O
looking O
at O
our O

we O
found O

the O
first O

of O
a O
Turla B-ACT

called O
Mosquito S-ACT

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
generic B-TOOL
tools E-TOOL
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source B-TOOL
password I-TOOL
dumpers E-TOOL
such O
as O
Mimikatz S-TOOL
. O

Starting O
in O
March B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign S-ACT
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation S-ACT
framework O
Metasploit S-TOOL
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito O

. O

Even O
an O

can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious B-FILE

that O

apparently O
from O

since O
the O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
Metasploit S-TOOL
as O
a O
first O
stage O

, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O

was O
intercepted O

, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O

we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O
Mosquito B-ACT

In O
this O

we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla B-ACT

campaign E-ACT
over O
the O
last O
few O

Primary O

Turla S-APT

, O
instead O
of O
directly O

The O
Turla S-APT
espionage S-ACT
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Carbon S-MAL
, O
a O
second O
stage O
backdoor O
in O
the O
Turla S-APT

The O
Turla S-APT
group O
is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O
stages O
, O
first O
doing O
reconnaissance S-ACT
on O
their O
victims' B-IDTY
systems E-IDTY
before O
deploying O
their O
most O
sophisticated B-ACT

in O
mid-February S-TIME
2017 S-TIME
. O

Like O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
activity E-ACT
, O
WhiteBear S-MAL
leverages O
compromised B-ACT
websites E-ACT
and O
hijacked O
satellite O

for O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
infrastructure O
. O

WhiteBear S-MAL
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
Skipper B-TOOL
Turla E-APT
cluster O
of O
activity S-ACT
documented O
in O
another O
private O
intelligence O
report O
" O
Skipper B-TOOL
Turla E-APT
– O
the O
White B-MAL
Atlas E-TOOL
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 S-TIME
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear S-MAL
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February S-TIME
to O
September B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity E-ACT
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies S-IDTY
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity E-ACT
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
into O
June B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear S-MAL
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies S-IDTY
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla S-APT
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails S-ACT
sent O
by O
the O
German B-IDTY
Foreign I-IDTY
Office I-IDTY
staff E-IDTY
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla S-APT
operators O
for O
this O
campaign S-ACT
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft O
Outlook O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The O
Bat! O
, O
a O
mail O
client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla S-APT
steals O
emails S-ACT
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails S-ACT
to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European B-IDTY
governments E-IDTY
and O
defense B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-FILE
documents E-TOOL
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 S-TIME
, O
multiple O
media S-IDTY
claimed O
that O
Turla S-APT
operators O
used O
mail B-ACT
attachments E-ACT
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate B-ACT
and I-ACT
exfiltrate I-ACT
emails E-ACT
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla S-APT
is O
the O
only O
espionage S-ACT
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails S-ACT
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-FILE
attachments E-TOOL
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla S-APT
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar S-MAL
, O
which O
is O
a O
Trojan O
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET O
Framework O
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-TOOL
tool E-TOOL
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla S-APT
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos S-APT
and O
Snake S-APT
) O
, O
who O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
compromised O
embassies S-IDTY
, O
defense B-IDTY
contractors E-IDTY
, O
educational B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
, O
and O
research B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured B-TOOL
backdoor E-MAL
controlled O
by O
email S-ACT
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla S-APT
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla S-APT
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code B-ACT
lineage E-ACT
in O
Kazuar S-MAL
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 S-TIME
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla S-APT
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar S-MAL
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon S-MAL
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
tools O
such O
as O
NoFuserEx S-TOOL
, O
ConfuserEx B-TOOL
Fixer E-TOOL
, O
ConfuserEx B-TOOL
Switch I-TOOL
Killer E-TOOL
, O
and O
de4d0t S-TOOL
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O
the O
code O
for O
in O
depth O
analysis O
. O

Kazuar S-SECTEAM
generates B-ACT
its I-ACT
mutex E-ACT
by O
using O
a O
process O
that O
begins O
with O
obtaining O
the O
MD5 S-ENCR
hash O
of O
a O
string O
" O
[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex O
" O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
against O
private B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
. O

e O
uncovered O
the O
activity S-ACT
of O
a O
hacking S-ACT
group O
which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API B-ACT
access E-ACT
, O
Turla S-APT
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump B-ACT
data E-ACT
to O
and O
exfiltrate B-ACT
data E-ACT
from O
. O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O
and O
specializes O
in O
cyberattacks S-ACT
against O
the O
online B-IDTY
video I-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
threat O
actors O
may O
compile O
Windows S-OS
and O
Unix S-OS
based O
payloads O
using O
the O
same O
code O
to O
deploy O
Kazuar S-SECTEAM

APT5 S-APT
has O

its O

The O

While O

However O
, O
to O

Our O
direct O

Bahamut S-APT

the O

were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian B-IDTY

– O
an O

commonly O

such O

Once O
inside O
a O

APT40 S-APT

allowing O

the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O

Bahamut S-APT

shown O
to O
be O

, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O

running B-ACT

although O
the O

In O

employing O
the O

Our O
primary O
contribution O

is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut S-APT
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O

and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O

As O

then O
, O
compared O
to O

Bahamut S-APT

After O

these O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut S-APT
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut S-APT
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform B-IDTY
providers E-IDTY
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut S-APT
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support B-ACT
of I-IDTY
its I-ACT
espionage I-ACT
activities E-ACT
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-TOOL
software E-TOOL
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut S-APT
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing S-ACT
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more I-ACT
passwords E-IDTY
. O

Bahamut S-APT
spearphishing S-ACT
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google S-IDTY
about O
security O
issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
flash O
text O
" O
. O

These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email O
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut S-APT
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut S-APT
's O
campaigns S-ACT
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage E-ACT
or O
information B-ACT

not O

have O
deployed O
the O
Bookworm B-TOOL

primarily O
in O
attacks S-ACT

The O
threat O
actors O
use O
a O
commercial O

encapsulate O

Using O

a O
common O
technique O
to O
quickly O
find B-ACT

The O

be O
a O
modular B-TOOL
Trojan E-MAL
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O

also O
load O

Although O
the O
developers O

included O
only O
keylogging S-ACT

in O
Bookworm S-MAL

a O
core O
ability O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
Table O

several O

While O

we O

Also O
, O
Bookworm S-MAL

obfuscate B-ACT
the I-ACT

The O

The O

use O
these O

in O
a O
rather O
unique O
way O
, O
as O
the O
other O

out O
its O
tasks O

aware O
of O
attempted O
attacks S-ACT

at O
least O
two O
branches O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks S-ACT
delivering O
Bookworm S-MAL
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand S-LOC
based O
on O
the O
contents O

several O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O

continue O
development O
Bookworm S-MAL

and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm S-MAL

Analysis O
of O
compromised O

seen O
communicating O

confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O

a O
majority O
of O

existing O
within O
Thailand S-LOC

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm S-MAL
, O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
sends B-ACT
a O
static I-ACT
date I-ACT
string E-ACT
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-TOOL
code E-TOOL
to O
track O
their O
attack B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier E-ACT
for O
the O
Trojan O
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
hardcoded E-FILE
into O
each O
Bookworm B-TOOL
sample E-TOOL
as O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier E-ACT
. O

A O
Trojan O
sending O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier E-ACT
to O
its O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date B-FILE
string E-FILE
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date B-FILE
codes E-FILE
are O
used O
for O
campaign B-ACT
tracking E-ACT
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm S-MAL
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-TOOL
samples E-MAL
use O
the I-ACT
static I-ACT
date I-ACT
string E-ACT
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack S-ACT
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O

CVE-2012-0158 S-VULID
, O
CVE-2013-3906 S-VULID
or O
CVE-2014-1761 S-VULID
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap S-APT
using O
this O
method O
from O
May B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
to O
August B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-TOOL
websites E-TOOL
to O
spread O
Buhtrap S-MAL
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit O
kit B-VULNAME
Niteris E-VULNAME
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow S-MAL
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks S-ACT
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing B-ACT
email E-ACT
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia S-LOC
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap S-APT
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses S-IDTY
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing S-ACT
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap S-APT
add O
strategic B-ACT
web I-ACT
compromises E-ACT
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-TOOL
downloader E-TOOL
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October B-TIME
26th E-TIME
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe S-FILE
or O
AmmyySvc.exe S-FILE
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap S-APT
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-TOOL
websites E-TOOL
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-TOOL
banking I-MAL
trojan E-TOOL
, O
Buhtrap S-APT
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian S-LOC
banks S-IDTY
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal S-ACT
money E-ACT
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses S-IDTY
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs S-IDTY
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants S-IDTY
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap S-APT
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 S-TIME
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM S-TOOL
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial S-IDTY
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing S-ACT
money E-ACT
from O
Russian S-LOC
financial B-IDTY
establishments E-IDTY
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap S-APT
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 S-TIME
in O
the O
TwoBee B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 S-TIME
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap S-APT
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-TOOL
Trojan E-MAL
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap S-APT
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news B-IDTY
outlets E-IDTY
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning B-ACT
off I-ACT
assets I-ACT
in I-ACT
transactions E-ACT
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign S-ACT
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting B-IDTY
departments E-IDTY
in O
Russian O
businesses S-IDTY
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O
" O
accountant O
" O
in O
Russian S-LOC
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign S-ACT
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak S-MAL
Carbanak S-MAL
documented O
by O
Fox-IT S-SECTEAM
and O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz S-TOOL
application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-TOOL
remote I-TOOL
access I-TOOL
tool E-TOOL
, O
changes O
system O
settings O
to O
allow O
concurrent O

and O
so O
on O

In O
addition O
to O
built-in O
functionalities O
, O
the O
operators O
of O
Careto S-MAL
can O
upload B-ACT
additional I-ACT

which O
can O
perform O
any O

. O

Careto S-MAL

we O
discovered O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing B-ACT
e-mails E-ACT
with O
links O
to O
a O

website O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
attackers O
use O
sub-domains S-DOM
on O
the O
exploit O
websites O
, O
to O
make O
them O
seem O
more O

These O
sub-domains O
simulate O

The O
CVE-2012-0773 S-VULID
was O
originally O
discovered O
by O
VUPEN O
and O
has O
an O
interesting O
story O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O

attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
attempting O
to O
exploit O

a O
strong O
affinity O
for O
PHP O

this O
is O
relatively O
unique O
amongst O

who O
often O
favor O

at O
a O

Clever B-APT

primarily O
targets O
global O

to O
countries O
that O
are O
contrary O
to O

. O

A O
Clever B-ACT

attack E-ACT
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
web B-TOOL

to O
conduct O

. O

The O
scanner O
was O

is O
a O

Once O

will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote B-IDTY
access E-IDTY
to O
the O

. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O

against O

, O
which O
for O
a O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
IT B-IDTY

not O

their O

In O

In O
2013 S-TIME
, O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
reported O
on O
a O
series O
of O
relatively O
amateur O
attacks S-ACT
against O
Pakistani O
targets O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A S-MAL
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O

associated O
with O
a O

method O
commonly O

aka O
ByeByeShell S-MAL

first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
in O
2013 S-TIME
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B S-MAL
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A S-MAL
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-FILE
binary I-FILE
files E-FILE
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
executable E-MAL
is O
disguised S-ACT

using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override S-TOOL
( O
RTLO S-TOOL
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false B-ACT

. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity S-ACT
have O
links O
to O
attacks S-ACT
with O
likely O
Indian B-LOC
origins E-LOC
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT

are O
linked O

a O
loose O

The O
two O

families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O

an O

Since O
January B-TIME

we've O
been O
on O
the O

a O
possible O
RedOctober S-APT

One O
possible O

was O
triggered O
when O
we O
observed O
Mevade O

an O
unusual O

appeared O
late O

2013 S-TIME

In O
August B-TIME
2014 E-TIME

some O

observed O

with O
a O
variation O
of O
CVE-2012-0158 S-VULID

an O
unusual O
set O
of O

. O

It O
wasn't O
until O
August B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
that O
we O
observed O
something O
which O
made O
us O
wonder O
if O
RedOctober O
is O
back O
for O
good O
. O

The O
Cloud O
Atlas O
implants O
utilize O
a O
rather O
unusual O
C&C B-ACT
mechanism E-ACT
. O

We O
named O
it O
RedOctober O
because O
we O
started O
this O
investigation O
in O
October B-TIME
2012 E-TIME
, O
an O
unusually O
hot O

The O

particularly O
the O
IT S-IDTY

financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks S-ACT

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O

the O
RBS S-IDTY

installed O
in O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk S-MAL
. O

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian B-LOC
cybercriminal E-LOC
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity S-ACT
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O

In O
Russia S-LOC

there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O

groups O
engaged O
in O
financial B-ACT
theft E-ACT
via O
attacks S-ACT
on O
RBS S-IDTY

In O
April B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-TOOL
module E-TOOL
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks S-ACT
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks S-IDTY
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O

legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded B-ACT
additional I-ACT
modules E-ACT

ones O
allowing B-ACT

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 S-TIME
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O

seriously O
reduced O

Most O
of O
the O

are O
mwapi32.dll S-FILE

it O
should O
be O
pointed O
though O
that O
the O

generally O
unique O

have O
never O
been O
used O
twice O

saw O
within O
the O
samples O

as O
well O
as O
the O

the O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-TOOL
Thai I-TOOL

to O
host B-ACT
the I-ACT

which O
is O
a O
tactic O

each O

tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O

using O

alone O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-MAL

using O
the O

a O

The O
attacks S-ACT

that O

took O

in O
late O

It O

another O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
some O
previous O
targeted B-ACT

the O
attackers O
in O
this O
incident O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
services O

establish B-ACT
free I-ACT

. O

Blending O

a O
common O
tactic O

to O
help O

on O
the O
patterns O
of O
subdomain O

TRAC S-SECTEAM
believes O
this O

the O

our O
knowledge O

for O
a O
lack O

call O

due O
to O
a O

This O

in O
a O
2013 S-TIME

These O

several O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 S-TIME
, O
2015 S-TIME
, O
and O
2016 S-TIME
KeyBoy B-MAL

provide O

that O
the O

the O
CVE-2012-0158 S-VULID

. O

The O

illustrates O
the O
continued O
use O
of O
malicious B-FILE

in O
the O

bearing I-TOOL

. O

Chances O
are O
about O
even O
, O
though O
, O
that O
Mofang S-APT
is O
a O
relevant O
threat O
actor O
to O
any O
organization O
that O
invests O
in O
Myanmar S-LOC
or O
is O
otherwise O
politically S-IDTY
involved O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
campaign S-ACT
in O
Myanmar S-LOC
, O
Mofang S-APT
has O
been O
observed O
to O

This O

gives O
insight O
into O
some O
of O
the O
information O
that O
Fox-IT S-SECTEAM
has O
about O
a O
threat O
actor O
that O
it O
follows O
, O
called O
Mofang S-APT

The O
name O
Mofang S-APT
is O
based O
on O
the O
Mandarin O
verb O
, O
which O
means O
to O
imitate O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-APT
group E-APT
is O
a O
group O
that O
operates O
out O
of O
China S-LOC
and O
is O
probably O
government-affiliated O
. O

which O
was O

Since O
at O

2013 S-TIME
, O
Nitro S-APT
appears O
to O
have O
somewhat O
modified O
their O

Attacks S-ACT
on O
the O
chemical B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack S-ACT
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect S-ACT
intellectual B-IDTY
property E-IDTY
such O
as O
design O
documents O
, O
formulas O
, O
and O
manufacturing O
processes O
. O

The O
attack S-ACT
wave O
started O
in O
late O
July B-TIME
2011 E-TIME
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 S-TIME
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks S-ACT
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage S-ACT
, O
collecting S-ACT
intellectual B-IDTY
property E-IDTY
for O
competitive O
advantage O
. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
in O
late O
May S-TIME
. O

From O
late O
April O
to O
early O

the O

focused O
on O
human O

Attackers O
then O
moved O
on O
to O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
against O
the O
chemical B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
began O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O
desired O
targets O
and O
then O
sent O
an O
email S-ACT
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious B-ACT
emails E-ACT
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O
emails S-ACT
were O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broad O
set O
of O

, O
the O

The O
attacks S-ACT
were O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
computer O

that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O

Attackers O
are O
sending O
malicious O

which O
use O

to O
drop O
variants O

Operation B-ACT
Ghoul E-ACT
is O
one O
of O
the O
many O
attacks S-ACT
in O
the O
wild O
targeting O
industrial S-IDTY
, O
manufacturing S-IDTY
and O
engineering B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
, O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM

recommends O
users O
to O
be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O
and O
opening O
emails S-EMAIL
and O
attachments S-FILE
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-ACT
Groundbait E-ACT
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks S-ACT
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government B-IDTY
separatists E-IDTY
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks S-ACT
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high B-IDTY
profile I-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks S-ACT
is O
clearly O
espionage S-ACT
– O
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 S-TIME
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
and O
North B-LOC
Africa E-LOC
( O
MENA S-LOC
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks S-ACT
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing B-ACT
attack E-ACT
that O
targeted O
political S-IDTY
figures O
in O
the O
MENA S-LOC
region O
. O

Like O
BlackEnergy S-MAL
( O
a.k.a O
Sandworm S-APT

, O
Potao S-MAL
is O
an O
example O

a O
number O
of O
other O
CIS O
countries O
, O
including O
Russia S-LOC
, O
Georgia S-LOC
and O
Belarus S-LOC
. O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O
in O
Potao S-MAL
detections O
in O
2014 S-TIME
and O
2015 S-TIME
were O
infections O
through O

. O

The O
first O
Potao B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
that O
we O
examined O
took O
place O
in O
August B-TIME
2011 E-TIME
. O

In O
March B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
the O
gang O
behind O
Potao S-MAL
started O
using O
a O
new O
infection B-TOOL
vector E-TOOL
. O

Since O
March B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
ESET S-SECTEAM
has O
detected O
Potao S-MAL
binaries O
at O
several O
high-value O

that O
the O

are O
still O
very O
active O
even O
at O
the O

, O
a O
so-called O

In O
September B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
we O
discovered O
Silence B-ACT
attack E-ACT
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing B-ACT
email E-ACT
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-ACT
attack E-ACT
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking S-IDTY
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing B-ACT
emails E-ACT
from O
the O

of O
real O
bank B-IDTY
employees E-IDTY
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O

. O

The O
spear-phishing S-ACT
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
way O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns S-ACT
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack S-ACT
is O
Silence O
group O
, O
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O

A O

that O

the O

useful O

The O

we O

that O

part O

a O
more O
extensive O

, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
operating O
mainly O
on O

These O

represent O
an O
evolution O

Based O
on O

that O

in O
the O
middle O

February B-TIME
2016 E-TIME

the O

the O

provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O

A O
previous O
campaign O
of O
this O
APT O

was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos S-SECTEAM
in O
June B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O
operation O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

ined O
in O
the O

DriverInstallerU.exe S-FILE
but O
its O

shows O
that O
its O
original O

is O
Interenet B-FILE
Assistant.exe E-FILE
. O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers S-APT
look O
for O
victims B-IDTY
who I-IDTY
answer E-IDTY
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O

are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O
profile O

In O
this O
sample O
, O
however O
, O
the O

were O
changed O
from O

up O
to O

But O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
attackers S-APT
known O
affection O
for O
decoy B-ACT
documents E-FILE
that O
pose O
as O
news O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
date O
the O
campaign O
back O
to O
March B-TIME
2018 E-TIME

With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT B-ACT
attack E-ACT
that O
began O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O
target O
, O
over O
a O

later O
. O

These O
unknown B-APT
actors E-APT
continued O
launching O
DDoS S-ACT
attacks O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

For O
simplicity O
, O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
is O
calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy E-APT
APT O

Since O
the O

one O

BlackEnergy S-APT
go O
back O

as O
June B-TIME

BlackEnergy S-APT
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O
and O
the O
current O
attacks O
in O

indicate O
that O
destructive O

on O
their O
main O
agenda O

in O

to O
compromising O

Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
the O
BlackEnergy S-APT
attacks O
in O
Ukraine S-LOC

update O
our O

with O
more O
data O
when O

From O
Buhtrap S-APT
perpetrating O
cybercrime O
for O
financial O

its O

been O
expanded O
with O

conduct O

Eastern B-LOC

Throughout O
our O

we've S-SECTEAM
seen O
this B-APT
group E-APT
deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor S-ACT
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O
victims O
, O
but O
June B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap S-APT
group O
use O
a O
zero-day B-ACT
exploit E-ACT
as O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
we O
observed O
Buhtrap S-APT

exploit O
, O
CVE-2019-1132 S-VULID

against O

However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O
targets O
occurred O
before O
the O
source O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O
same O
people O
behind O
the O
first O
Buhtrap S-APT

attacks O
against O
businesses S-IDTY
and O

are O
also O
involved O
in O

When O
Buhtrap S-APT
was O
targeting O
businesses S-IDTY
, O
the O
decoy O
documents O
would O
typically O
be O
contracts O
or O

The O
Buhtrap S-APT

is O
well O
known O
for O
its O

in O
a O

2014 S-TIME

When O
the O
group's S-APT
focus O
shifted O
to O

, O
the O

in O

In O
most O
cases O

threat B-APT
actors E-APT
typically O
stop O

slow B-ACT

publicly O

The O
threat B-APT
actors E-APT
behind O
the O
Sea B-ACT

were O
successful O
in O
compromising S-ACT

by O
manipulating O

falsifying B-ACT

records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O

If O
an O
attacker S-APT
was O
able O
to O
compromise S-ACT
an O

, O
the O
attacker O

be O

If O

obtain B-ACT

The O

how O
we O
believe O
the O

used O
DNS S-PROT
hijacking E-ACT

achieve O
their O

As O
of O
early B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT

came O
from O

which O

rather O

support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O

and O
the O
core O
of O
the O

, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ S-APT
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS S-PROT
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked S-ACT
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor S-APT
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS S-PROT
server E-ACT
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS S-PROT
queries O
. O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor S-APT
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-TOOL
servers E-TOOL
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture S-ACT
user B-IDTY
credentials E-IDTY
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-TOOL
server E-TOOL
IP O
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos S-SECTEAM
identified O
16 O
additional B-TOOL
servers E-TOOL
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor S-APT
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O

The O
attackers S-APT
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-ACT
operations E-ACT
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled S-APT
servers S-TOOL
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' S-APT
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-TOOL
applications E-TOOL
, O
such O
as O
Cisco O
Adaptive B-TOOL
Security I-TOOL

(ASA) S-TOOL
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we S-SECTEAM
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers S-APT
found O
a O
new O
ASA S-VULNAME
exploit S-VULNAME
. O

Rather O
, O
they O
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's S-TOOL
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN S-TOOL
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS S-PROT
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O
domain O
resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled S-APT
MitM B-TOOL
server E-TOOL
. O

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers S-APT
were O
able O
to O
compromise S-ACT
NetNod E-ACT
, O
a O
non-profit O

independent O
internet O

organization O
based O
in O

Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors S-APT
were O
able O
to O
manipulate S-ACT
the O
DNS S-PROT
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O

This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
attackers S-APT
to O
harvest S-ACT

with O
the O

, O
the O

actors E-APT
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based O

We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle E-ACT
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O

Obtaining B-ACT

Once O

they O
steal S-ACT

We S-SECTEAM
believe O
that O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle I-ACT
campaign E-ACT
continues O
to O
be O
highly O
successful O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Had O
more O

The O

that O

However O
, O

to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O
tensions O
in O
the O

The O

imitating S-ACT

With O

increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O

attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle B-LOC

The O

the O

show O
any O

The O
malware S-MAL
starts O
communicating B-ACT

by O
sending O
basic B-IDTY
information E-IDTY

basically O
provides O
a O
remote O

enabling O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O

was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O

designed O
to O
steal S-ACT

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
Amnesty O

published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O

It O
appears O
that O
the O

may O
have O
impersonated O
the O

stole S-ACT

the O

it O

This O
post O
was O
our O
first O
analysis O
of O
the O
first O
Panda B-MAL

campaign O
that O
we’ve O
seen O
to O
target O
financial B-IDTY

Operation B-APT
Pawn I-APT
Storm E-APT
is O
an O
active O
economic S-IDTY
and O
political S-IDTY
cyber-espionage B-ACT
operation E-ACT
that O
targets O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
entities O
, O
like O
the O
military S-IDTY
, O
governments S-IDTY
, O
defense B-IDTY
industries E-IDTY
, O
and O
the O
media S-IDTY
. O

We S-SECTEAM
believe O
the O
iOS B-MAL
malware E-MAL
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
next O
stage O
SEDNIT S-MAL
malware O
we O
have O
found O
for O
Microsoft O
Windows’ O
systems O
. O

We S-SECTEAM
found O
two O
malicious O
iOS O
applications O
in O
Operation O
Pawn B-ACT
Storm E-ACT
. O

One O
is O
called O
XAgent S-MAL
detected O
as O
IOS_XAGENT.A S-FILE
and O
the O
other O
one O
uses O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
iOS O
game O
, O
MadCap S-MAL
detected O
as O
IOS_ O
XAGENT.B S-FILE
. O

The O
obvious O
goal O
of O
the O
SEDNIT-related S-APT
spyware S-MAL
is O
to O
steal S-ACT
personal B-IDTY
data E-IDTY
, O
record O
audio O
, O
make O
screenshots O
, O
and O
send O
them O
to O
a O
remote O
command-and-control S-TOOL
(C&C) S-TOOL
server O
. O

Madcap S-MAL
is O
similar O
to O
the O
XAgent S-MAL
malware O
, O
but O
the O
former O
is O
focused O
on O
recording O
audio O
. O

Just O
to O

TajMahal S-MAL

The O
dropper S-ACT
first O
appeared O
in O
mid-July S-TIME
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
APT O
activity O
is O
potentially O
ongoing O
, O
with O
Turla S-APT
actively O
targeting O
G20 S-IDTY
participants O
and/or O
those O
with O
interest O
in O
the O
G20 O
, O
including O
member O
nations O
, O
journalists O
, O
and O
policymakers O
. O

Turla S-APT
is O
a O
well-documented O
, O
long O
operating O
APT O
group O
that O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
Russian S-LOC
state-sponsored S-IDTY
organization O
. O

Turla S-APT
is O
perhaps O
most O
notoriously O
suspected O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Command O
in O
2008 S-ACT
. O

More O
recently O
Turla S-APT
was O
accused O
of O
breaching S-ACT
RUAG S-IDTY
, O
a O
Swiss O
technology O
company O
, O
in O
a O
public O
report O
published O
by O
GovCERT.ch S-SECTEAM
. O

The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
in O
this O
instance O
is O
currently O
unknown O
as O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
researchers O
on O
a O
public O
malware O
repository O
. O

Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
ways O
it O
may O
have O
been O
delivered O
including O
some O
of O
Turla’s S-APT
previous O
attack O
methods O
such O
as O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
or O
via O
a O
watering B-ACT
hole E-ACT
. O

This O
could O
include O
diplomats S-IDTY
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O
Economy O
Task O
Force O

or O
possibly O
even O
journalists S-IDTY

Turla's S-APT
goal O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital B-IDTY
Economy E-IDTY
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists O
. O

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript B-MAL
(JS) I-FILE
dropper E-MAL
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS B-MAL
decryptor E-MAL
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
payload E-FILE
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating B-ACT
files S-FILE
to O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
as O
well O
as O
downloading B-ACT
files S-FILE
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial B-ACT
reconnaissance E-ACT
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turla’s S-APT
more O
fully O
featured O
implants O
. O

Turla S-APT
is O
a O
complex O
cyberattack O
platform O
focused O
predominantly O
on O
diplomatic O
and O
government-related O
targets O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
, O
Central S-LOC
and O
Far B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia E-LOC
, O
Europe S-LOC

We O
didn’t O
choose O
to O
name O
it O
after O
a O
vegetable; O
the O
.NET B-MAL
malware E-MAL
developers O
named O
it O
Topinambour S-MAL
themselves O
. O

The O
role O
of O
the O
.NET B-MAL
module E-MAL
is O
to O
deliver O
the O
known O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
JavaScript I-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
. O

Moreover O
, O
Turla S-APT
now O
also O
has O
a O
heavily O
obfuscated B-ACT
PowerShell I-ACT
Trojan E-ACT
that O
is O
similar O
to O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
. O

RocketMan S-MAL
probably O
a O
reference O
to O
Donald O
Trump’s O
nickname O
for O
Kim O
Jong O

MiamiBeach S-MAL
serve O
as O
the O
first O
beacon O
messages O
from O
the O
victim O
to O
the O

server O
. O

These O
could O
be O
tools O
to O
circumvent O
internet O
censorship O
, O
such O
as O
Softether B-TOOL
VPN I-TOOL
4.12 E-TOOL
and O
psiphon3 S-TOOL

Microsoft B-TOOL
Office I-TOOL
activators E-TOOL
. O

These O
campaign-related O
VPSs S-APT
are O
located O
in O
South B-LOC
Africa E-LOC
. O

The O
tool O
does O
all O
that O
a O
typical O
Trojan S-MAL
needs O
to O
accomplish: O
upload S-ACT
, O
download S-ACT
and O
execute S-ACT
files S-FILE
, O
fingerprint S-ACT
target B-IDTY
systems E-IDTY
. O

The O
PowerShell S-TOOL
version O
of O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
also O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
get B-ACT
screenshots E-ACT
. O

The O
Trojan S-MAL
is O
quite O
similar O
to O
the O
.NET B-MAL
RocketMan I-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
and O
can O
handle O
the O
same O
commands; O
additionally O
, O
it O
includes O
the O
#screen” O
command O
to O
take O
a O
screenshot O
. O

The O
usage O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
, O
a O
well-known O
and O
exclusive O
artefact O
previously O
used O
by O
the O
Turla S-APT
group O
, O
makes O
us O
attribute O
this O
campaign O
to O
this O
actor O
with O
high O
confidence O
. O

” O
says O
Costin B-SECTEAM
Raiu E-SECTEAM
, O
who O
has O
been O

One O
government O
official O
puts O
it O
very O
matter-of-factly: O
Winnti S-APT
is O
very O
specific O
to O
Germany S-LOC

By O
2014 S-TIME
, O
the O
Winnti B-MAL

code O
was O
no O

was O
discovered O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
and O
Henkel O

Far O
from O
attacking O
Henkel S-IDTY
and O
the O
other O
companies O
arbitrarily O
, O
Winnti S-APT
takes O
a O
highly O
strategic O
approach O
. O

The O
hackers S-APT
behind O
Winnti S-APT
have O
also O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
Japan’s S-LOC
biggest O
chemical B-IDTY
company E-IDTY

In O
the O
case O
of O
another O
Japanese O

APT41 S-APT

to O
have O

We O
believe O
these O

include O
broadly O
malicious B-ACT

that O
can O
enable O
further O
operations O

such O
as O
targeting O

Since O
at O

2012 S-TIME

APT41 S-APT
has O
repeatedly O
gained O

APT41 S-APT

In O
2018 S-TIME

the O

inserted B-ACT
CRACKSHOT I-ACT
malware E-ACT
into O
game O

that O
were O

with O
legitimate O

, O
most O
likely O
indicating O
access O

the O

which O
facilitated O
a O
supply O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT41 S-APT
limitedly O
deploy B-ACT

maintain O

on O
victim O

Selective O
deployment O
of O
ROCKBOOT S-SECTEAM
suggests O
that O
APT41 S-APT
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

APT41 S-APT

activity O
targeting O
the O

, O
including O
manipulating O
virtual O

In O
a O
highly O

APT41 S-APT
attempted O
to O
extort O

deploying S-ACT
the O

APT41 S-APT
is O
well-known O
for O
leveraging S-ACT
compromised O
digital O
certificates O
from O
video O
game O

to O
sign O

. O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 S-APT
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O
specific O
targeted O

, O
so O
the O
group O
resorted O
to O
ransomware S-ACT
to O
attempt O
to O
salvage B-ACT
their I-ACT
efforts E-ACT
and O
profit S-ACT
from O
the O
compromise O
. O

APT41 S-APT
has O
also O
used O
credentials B-ACT

previous O

In O
2014 S-TIME

APT41 S-APT

As O

APT41 S-APT
leverages O
a O

APT41 S-APT
is O
unique O
among O

China-based O
actors S-LOC
in O
that O
it O
leverages O
non-public O
malware O
typically O
reserved O
for O
espionage B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
in O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
activity O
for O
personal O
gain O
. O

During O
multiple O
engagements O
, O
APT41 S-APT
attempted O
to O
remove O
evidence O
of O
some O
of O
its O
activity O
by O
deleting B-ACT

Explicit O
financially-motivated O
targeting O
is O
unusual O
among O
Chinese B-LOC
statesponsored E-LOC
threat O
groups O
, O
and O
evidence O
suggests O
APT41 S-APT
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O
crime O
and O
cyber O
espionage S-ACT
operations O
from O
2014 S-TIME
onward O
. O

APT41 S-APT
operations O
against O
higher B-IDTY
education E-IDTY
, O
travel B-IDTY
services E-IDTY
, O
and O
news/media B-IDTY
firms E-IDTY
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
group S-APT
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom S-IDTY
companies S-IDTY
. O

APT41 S-APT
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare S-IDTY
, O
high-tech S-IDTY
, O
and O
telecommunications S-IDTY
sectors S-IDTY
. O

The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
, O
where O
APT41 S-APT
has O
manipulated S-ACT
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy S-ACT
ransomware S-ACT
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 S-APT
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked S-ACT
to O
reconnoiter O
the O
facility O
for O
security O
reasons O
. O

These O
supply B-ACT
chain E-ACT
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s S-APT
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage S-ACT
campaigns O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 S-APT
limits O
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching O
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O

Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 S-APT
primarily O
conducts S-ACT
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 S-APT
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage S-ACT
operations O
. O

APT41 S-APT
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-TOOL
families E-TOOL
and O
tools S-TOOL
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage S-ACT
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group S-APT
. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 S-APT
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy B-ACT
additional I-ACT
malware E-ACT
. O

APT41 S-APT
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing B-ACT
emails E-ACT
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
(.chm) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 S-APT
has O
also O
deployed B-ACT
rootkits E-ACT
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 S-APT
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves B-ACT
more I-ACT
advanced I-ACT
TTPs E-ACT
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage S-ACT
operators O
, O
APT41 S-APT
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
away O
from O
direct O
intellectual B-ACT
property I-ACT
theft E-ACT
since O
2015 S-TIME
. O

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O
group's S-APT
consistent O
interest O
in O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
for O
financially O
motivated O
reasons O

Our O
findings O

that O
the O

we O
consider O
them O
a O

In O
some O
of O
the O
latest O

The O
BalkanDoor S-MAL

Based O
on O
the O

ESET S-SECTEAM
has O
seen O
over O
50 O

with O
more O

half O

Machete S-APT

been O
developed O
by O
a O
Spanish-speaking S-LOC

presumably O
from O

Machete S-APT
was O
active O

constantly O
working O

very O
effective O
spearphishing S-ACT

In O
some O
cases O
, O
Machete S-APT
trick O
new O

by O
sending B-ACT
real I-ACT

that O
had O
been O

the O
very O

Machete S-APT
relies O
on O
spearphishing S-ACT

compromise O
its O

They S-APT
seem O
to O
have O
specialized O
knowledge O
about O

as O
they O
are O
focused O
on O
stealing S-ACT
specific I-ACT

such O
as O
those O
that O
describe B-ACT

Attackers S-APT
take O
advantage O
of O
that O
, O
along O
with O
their O
knowledge O
of O
military S-IDTY
jargon O
and O
etiquette O
, O
to O
craft O
very O
convincing O
phishing B-ACT

Operators O
behind O

Once O

At O
the O

In O
2018 S-TIME
, O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM

published O
a O
report O
that O

a O
Turla S-APT
PowerShell B-TOOL
loader E-TOOL
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod O
. O

Turla S-APT
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 S-TIME
, O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O
military S-IDTY
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
PowerShell S-TOOL
in-memory O
loaders O
to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O
bypassing O

. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O

are O
used O
more O
globally O
against O
many O
traditional O
Turla S-APT

in O
Western B-LOC
Europe E-LOC

In O
some O

Based O
on O
our O
research O
, O
SWEED S-APT
— O
which O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O

2017 S-TIME
— O
primarily O
targets O
their O
victims O
with O
stealers O
and O
remote O

. O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
Turla S-APT

This O

not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
open-source O

designed O

passively O
listen B-ACT

One O
attack O
during O

involved O
the O
use O
of O

belonging O
to O
another O
espionage S-ACT
group O
known O
as O
Crambus S-APT

OilRig S-APT
, O

Waterbug S-APT
has O
been O
using O
Meterpreter S-TOOL
since O
at O
least O
early B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
and O
, O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
used O
a O
modified O
version O
of O

which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O
extension O
in O

to O
disguise O

true O
purpose O
. O

In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s S-APT
use O
of O
Crambus B-TOOL
infrastructure E-TOOL
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s S-APT
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
, O
Waterbug S-APT
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage S-ACT
group S-APT
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug S-APT
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group S-APT
compromise B-IDTY
governments E-IDTY
and O
international B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT S-IDTY
and O
education B-IDTY
sectors E-IDTY
. O

Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug S-APT
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure S-IDTY
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz S-TOOL
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug S-APT
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz S-TOOL
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
against O
an O
education S-IDTY
target O
in O
the O
UK S-LOC
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O

The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug S-APT
activity O
came O
on O
January B-TIME
11 E-TIME
, O
2018 S-TIME

when O
a O

dropped O

a O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle B-LOC
Eastern E-LOC
target O
, O
Crambus S-APT
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O

the O

network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November B-TIME

Waterbug’s S-APT
intrusions S-ACT
on O
the O

continued O
for O

that O
Waterbug S-APT
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus B-IDTY

as O
an O
initial O
access O
point O
. O

the O
Microsoft O

to O

In O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O

we O
believe O
the O

then O
the O

The O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A S-MAL
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O

a O

associated O

commonly O

first O
reported O
by O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B S-MAL
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A S-MAL
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-FILE
binary I-FILE

The O
CONFUCIUS_B S-MAL

is O

using O
a O

a O

. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity S-ACT
have O
links O
to O
attacks S-ACT
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
are O
linked O
to O
the O

of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL S-MAL

the O

The O
two O

themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O

is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development B-IDTY
company E-IDTY

behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A S-MAL

Yokohama S-MAL
. O

Just O
to O
highlight O
its O
capabilities O
, O
TajMahal S-MAL
is O
able O
to O
steal S-ACT

from O
a O

as O
from O
the O

The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
in O
this O

is O
currently O
unknown O
as O

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O

and O
a O
Javascript B-MAL
JS I-MAL
dropper E-MAL
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-MAL
dropper E-MAL
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS B-MAL
decryptor E-MAL
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
payload E-FILE

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-MAL
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating B-ACT

to O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
as O
well O
as O
downloading B-ACT

The O
threat O
actors S-APT
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM

, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise S-ACT

and O
compromising S-ACT
payment B-IDTY

. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors S-APT
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O

to O
generate B-ACT
further I-ACT

The O
members O

on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove B-ACT

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them S-FILE
using O
virtual I-ACT
private I-ACT

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O

of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise S-ACT
or O
acquire O
already O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group S-APT
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O

and O
other O

These O

for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O

. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O

, O
these O
actors S-APT
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O

to O
generate B-ACT
new I-ACT

numbers E-ACT
based O
on O
the O

, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

The O
actors S-APT
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create B-ACT
cloned I-ACT
physical I-ACT
cards E-ACT
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw B-ACT
funds E-ACT
from O

The O
group S-APT
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-TOOL

and O
Hardware S-TOOL
(Figure O

to O
create B-ACT

However O
, O
Brazilian S-LOC
actors S-APT
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen B-ACT

The O
individuals S-APT

are O
no O

have O
taken O
three O
approaches O

The O

also O

we O

used O

rather O
than O
a O

that O

use O
the I-ACT

The O
lack O
of O
any O

any O
of O
these O
backdoor O
families O
is O
another O
clue O
as O
to O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
resources O
on O
which O
the O
activity B-APT
group E-APT
is O
able O
to O
draw O
, O
and O
the O
precautions O
the O
group S-APT
is O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
take O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
losing O
its O
ability O
to O
conduct B-ACT
its I-ACT
espionage I-ACT
operations E-ACT
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Dipsind S-MAL
and O
its O
variants O
, O
PLATINUM S-APT
uses O
a O
few O
other O
families O
of O
custom-built B-MAL
backdoors E-TOOL
within O
its O
attack O
toolset O
. O

The O
PLATINUM B-APT
group E-APT
has O
written O
a O
few O
different O
versions O
of O
keyloggers S-MAL
that O
perform O
their O
functions O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
most O
likely O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
different O
weaknesses O
in O
victims O
' O
computing O
environments O
. O

While O
one O
family O
relies O
on O
a O
small O
number O
of O
supported O
commands O
and O
simple O
shells O
, O
the O
other O
delves O
into O
more O
convoluted O
methods O
of O
injections O
, O
checks O
, O
and O
supported O
feature O
sets O
. O

Both O
groups S-APT
can O
set B-ACT

Everyone O
, O
and O
work O
in O
tandem O
with O
the O
PLATINUM B-TOOL

. O

In O
particular O
, O
this O
second O
group S-APT
also O
has O
the O
capability O
of O
dumping O
users O
' O
credentials O
using O
the O
same O
technique O
employed O
by O
Mimikatz S-TOOL

In O
addition O
to O
using O
several O
publicly O
known O

methods O
to O
perform O
this O
task O
, O
it O
also O
takes O
advantage O
of O
an O
obscure O
operating O
system O
feature O
known O
as O
hot O
patching O
. O

One O
of O
PLATINUM S-APT
's O
most O
recent O
and O
interesting O
tools O
is O
meant O
to O
inject O

using O
a O
variety O
of O
injection B-ACT
techniques E-ACT
. O

At O
a O
high O
level O
, O

can O
transparently O
apply B-ACT

in O
actively O
running O

, O
which O
does O
not O
happen O
with O
traditional O
methods O
of O
code O

such O
as O
CreateRemoteThread S-FILE

WriteProcessMemory S-FILE
. O

Hot O
patching O
is O
an O
operating B-TOOL
system-supported I-TOOL
feature E-TOOL
for O
installing B-ACT
updates E-ACT
without O
having O
to O

. O

Multiple O
Dipsind S-MAL
variants O
have O
been O
identified O
, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
used O
exclusively O
by O
PLATINUM S-APT

The O
group S-APT

The O
technique O

We O
confirmed O
that O
the O

is O
that O

Another O
possibility O
is O
that O

that O
granted O

a O

We O

Unit B-SECTEAM

believes O
this O
group S-APT
is O
previously O
unidentified O
and O
therefore O
have O
we O
have O
dubbed O
it O
" O
RANCOR S-APT
" O
. O

The O
Rancor B-APT
group E-APT
's O
attacks S-ACT
use O
two O
primary O
malware O
families O
which O
we O
describe O
in O
depth O
later O
in O
this O
blog O
and O
are O
naming O
DDKONG S-MAL
and O
PLAINTEE S-MAL
. O

We O
identified O
decoy B-FILE
files E-FILE
which O
indicate O
these O
attacks S-ACT
began O
with O
spear B-ACT
phishing I-ACT
messages E-ACT
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O
actual O
messages O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor S-APT
attackers S-APT
were O
targeting O
political B-IDTY
entities E-IDTY
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy B-FILE
documents E-FILE
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O
government O
website O
belonging O
to O
the O
Cambodia B-IDTY
Government E-IDTY
and O
in O
at O
least O
once O
case O
, O
Facebook S-IDTY
. O

Our O
Investigation O
into O
both O
clusters O
further O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
both O
involved O
in O
attacks S-ACT
targeting O
organizations O
in O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia E-LOC
. O

We O
observed O
DDKONG S-MAL
in O
use O
between O
February B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
and O
the O
present O
, O
while O
PLAINTEE S-MAL
is O
a O
newer O
addition O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
sample O
being O
observed O
in O
October B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

The O
RANCOR B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
represents O
a O
continued O
trend O
of O
targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
against O
entities O
within O
the O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia E-LOC
region O
. O

They O
are O
interested O
in O
users O
of O
remote O
banking O
systems O
( O
RBS S-IDTY
) O
, O
mainly O
in O
Russia S-LOC
and O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

That O
this O
group S-APT
is O
mostly O
targeting O
businesses S-IDTY
is O
apparent O
from O
the O
processes O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
on O
a O
compromised O
system O
. O

While O
both O
RTM S-TOOL
and O
Buhtrap S-MAL
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quite O
similar O
process O
list O
, O
the O
infection O
vectors O
are O
quite O
different O
. O

This O
group S-APT
has O
used O
a O
large O
array O
of O
infection O
vectors O
, O
mostly O
revolving O
around O
drive-by B-ACT
downloads E-ACT
and O
spam S-ACT
. O

They O
are O
both O
targeting O
businesses S-IDTY
using O
accounting O
software O
, O
are O
fingerprinting O
systems O
of O
interest O
similarly O
, O
are O
looking O
for O
smart O
card O
readers O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
they O
deploy O
an O
array O
of O
malicious O
tools O
to O
spy O
on O
their O
victims O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
samples O
SHA-1 S-ENCR
AA0FA4584768CE9E16D67D8C529233E99FF1BBF0 S-SHA1
and O
48BC113EC8BA20B8B80CD5D4DA92051A19D1032B S-SHA1
. O

Despite O
its O
known O
weaknesses O
, O
the O
RC4 S-ENCR
algorithm O
is O
regularly O
used O
by O
malware O
authors O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
use O
of O
the O
relatively O
unique O
PLAINTEE B-MAL

the O

paths O
on O

each O
cluster O
, O
and O
the O
similar O
targeting O
, O
we O
have O
grouped O
these O
attacks S-ACT
together O
under O
the O
RANCOR B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
moniker O
. O

Bdo O
is O
the O
Russian S-LOC
translation O
for O
RBS S-IDTY
( O
Remote B-IDTY
Banking I-IDTY
System E-IDTY
) O
so O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
RBS S-IDTY
is O
a O
target O
for O
this O
malware O
. O

Other O
groups S-APT
, O
such O
as O
Buhtrap S-APT
, O
Corkow S-APT
and O
Carbanak S-APT
, O
were O
already O

to O

and O
successfully O
steal S-ACT
money E-ACT
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
their O
customers S-IDTY
in O
Russia S-LOC
. O

Our O
research O
on O
the O
RTM B-MAL

shows O
that O
the O
Russian S-LOC
banking B-IDTY
system E-IDTY
is O
still O
a O

though O
some O
evidence O

even O
earlier O
activity S-ACT

Threat B-APT
actors E-APT
, O

The O
tools O

techniques O
used O

consistent O
with O
several O
Chinese S-LOC
threat B-APT
actors E-APT

such O
as O

The O

began O
with O
a O

from O
which O
the O

The O
initial O
indicator O

uncovered O
several O

The O

leverage O
the O

The O
malware S-MAL
appends O

with O
the O

extension E-FILE
, O
drops O

executes O
a O

and O
demands O
$300 O
or O
$600 O
USD O
(via O

The O
malware S-MAL
then O
builds O
two O

in O
memory O
– O
they O
are O
32 O
and O
64-bit O
DLLs O
that O

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime B-APT
group E-APT
that O
specializes O
in O
payment B-ACT
card E-ACT
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors S-APT
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
Labs E-SECTEAM
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
credentials E-IDTY
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking S-ACT
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising S-ACT
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
processing I-IDTY
devices E-IDTY
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors S-APT
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate B-ACT
further I-ACT
card I-ACT
information S-IDTY
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group S-APT
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner S-TOOL
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove B-ACT
any I-ACT
evidence E-ACT
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors S-APT
is O
changing B-ACT
their I-ACT
system's E-ACT
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors S-APT
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-TOOL
MAC I-TOOL
Address I-TOOL
Changer E-TOOL
. O

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors S-APT
using O
Tor S-TOOL
or O
proxy-based B-TOOL
tools E-TOOL
similar O
to O
Tor S-TOOL
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them S-FILE
using O
virtual I-ACT
private I-ACT
network I-ACT
services E-ACT
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure B-ACT
anonymity E-ACT
and O
obfuscate B-ACT
criminal I-ACT
operations E-ACT
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group S-APT
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise S-ACT
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian S-LOC
threat O
actors S-APT
via O
social B-ACT
media I-IDTY
forums E-IDTY
such O
as O
Facebook O
, O
Skype O
, O
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp S-TOOL
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group S-APT
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-TOOL
credentials E-TOOL
, O
personal B-TOOL
information E-TOOL
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O
forums O
for O
fraud B-ACT
purposes E-ACT
. O

These O
actors S-APT
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly B-ACT
access I-ACT
databases E-ACT
. O

They S-APT
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian S-LOC
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil S-LOC
. O

The O
group S-APT
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-TOOL
injection E-TOOL
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij O
Advanced O
SQL O
Injection O
Tool O
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O
4) O
to O
scan S-ACT
for E-ACT
and O
exploit B-ACT
vulnerabilities E-ACT
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers S-APT
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S S-LOC
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-TOOL
credentials E-TOOL
, O
these O
actors S-APT
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate B-ACT
new I-ACT
card I-ACT
numbers E-ACT
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk B-TOOL
card-checking E-TOOL
tool O
this O
group S-APT
uses O
is O
Testador O

. O

Despite O
its O
name O
, O
this O

but O
exploits O
an O

to O
create B-ACT

physical I-ACT
cards E-ACT
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw B-ACT

uses O
the O

In O
April B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
we O
uncovered O
the O
malicious O
efforts O
of O
APT30 S-APT
, O
a O
suspected O
China-based S-LOC
threat O
group O
that O
has O
exploited O
the O
networks O
of O
governments S-IDTY
and O
organizations S-IDTY
across O
the O
region O
, O
targeting O
highly O
sensitive B-IDTY
political E-IDTY
, O
economic S-IDTY
and O
military S-IDTY
information O
. O

The O
individuals S-APT
using O
Hancitor S-MAL
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor S-MAL
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal S-ACT
data E-IDTY
from O
their O
victims O
. O

We O
recently O
observed O
Hancitor S-APT
attacks O
against O
some O
of O
our O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
Exploit O
Guard O
customers O
. O

The O
group S-APT
has O
performed O
these O
activities O
at O
multiple O
locations O
across O
Brazil S-LOC
, O
possibly O
using O
multiple O
mules O
. O

Once O
downloaded O
and O
executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O
intermediate O
payload O
that O
further O
downloads O
a O
Pony B-MAL
DLL E-FILE
and O
Vawtrak S-MAL
executable O
, O
which O
perform O
data B-ACT
theft E-ACT
and O
connect S-ACT

a O

The O

in O
these O

is O
a O

a O

After O
the O

is O
executed O
, O
it O
downloads O
Pony S-MAL

Vawtrak S-MAL
malware O
variants O
to O
steal S-ACT
data E-IDTY
. O

Upon O
execution O
, O
it O
will O
communicate O
with O
an O

website O
to O
download S-ACT
a O
variant O
of O
the O

In O

FireEye S-SECTEAM

dissects O
this O
new O
ATM B-MAL
malware E-MAL
that O
we O
have O
dubbed O
RIPPER S-MAL
(due O
to O
the O
project O
name O
ATMRIPPER S-MAL
identified O
in O
the O
sample) O
and O
documents O
indicators O
that O
strongly O

this O

is O
the O
one O
used O
to O
steal S-ACT

in O
Thailand S-LOC
. O

RIPPER S-MAL
interacts B-ACT
with I-ACT
the I-ACT
ATM E-ACT
by O
inserting O
a O
specially O
manufactured O
ATM O
card O
with O
an O
EMV O
chip O
that O
serves O
as O
the O
authentication O
mechanism O
. O

RIPPER S-MAL
will O
examine S-ACT
the O
contents O
of O
directories O
associated O
with O
the O
targeted O
ATM B-IDTY
vendors E-IDTY
and O
will O
replace B-ACT
legitimate I-ACT
executables E-ACT
with O
itself O
. O

Once O
a O
valid O
card O
with O
a O
malicious O
EMV O
chip O
is O
detected O
, O
RIPPER S-MAL
will O
instantiate B-ACT
a O
timer E-ACT
to O
allow O
a O
thief O
to O
control B-ACT
the I-ACT
machine E-ACT
. O

This O
malware S-MAL
family O
can O
be O
used O
to O
compromise S-ACT
multiple I-ACT
vendor I-ACT
platforms E-ACT
and O
leverages B-ACT

that O
interacts S-ACT

. O

Ploutus-D S-MAL
also O
allows O
the O

Ploutus-D S-MAL

, O
only O

the O

The O

Based O

This O

that O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
researchers O
have O
discovered O
that O
this O
attack S-ACT
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
Whitefly S-APT
, O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 S-TIME
, O
has O
targeted O
organizations O
based O
mostly O
in O
Singapore O
across O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
sectors O
, O
and O
is O
primarily O
interested O
in O
stealing O
large O
amounts O
of O
sensitive O
information O
. O

Whitefly S-APT
compromises O
its O
victims O
using O
custom O
malware O
alongside O
open-source O
hacking S-ACT
tools O
and O
living O
off O
the O
land B-ACT
tactics E-ACT
, O
such O
as O
malicious O
PowerShell B-TOOL
scripts E-TOOL
. O

From O
mid-2017 S-TIME
to O
mid-2018 S-TIME
, O
Whitefly S-APT
launched O
targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
against O
multiple O
organizations O
. O

While O
most O
of O
these O
organizations O
were O
based O
in O
Singapore O
, O
some O
were O
multinational O
organizations O
with O
a O
presence O
in O
Singapore S-LOC
. O

To O
date O
, O
Whitefly S-APT
has O
attacked O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare S-IDTY
, O
media S-IDTY
, O
telecommunications S-IDTY
, O
and O
engineering B-IDTY
sectors E-IDTY
. O

Whitefly S-APT
first O
infects S-ACT
its O
victims O
using O
a O
dropper S-TOOL
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
malicious.exe S-FILE
or O
.dll B-FILE
file E-FILE
that O
is O
disguised S-ACT
as O
a O
document O
or O
image O
. O

If O
opened O
, O
the O
dropper S-TOOL
runs O
a O
loader O
known O
as O
Trojan.Vcrodat S-MAL
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Whitefly S-APT
has O
consistently O
used O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
search B-TOOL
order I-TOOL
hijacking E-TOOL
to O
run O
Vcrodat S-MAL
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
Vcrodat S-MAL
loads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
on O
to O
the O
victim O
's O
computer O
. O

Whitefly S-APT
rely O
heavily O
on O
tools O
such O
as O
Mimikatz S-TOOL
to O
obtain O
credentials S-IDTY
. O

Using O
these O
credentials O
, O
the O
attackers O
are O
able O
to O
compromise O
more O
machines O
on O
the O
network O
and O
, O
from O
those O
machines O
, O
again O
obtain O
more O
credentials S-IDTY
. O

Whitefly S-APT
usually O
attempts O
to O
remain O
within O
a O
targeted O
organization O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time—often O
months—in O
order O
to O
steal S-ACT
large O
volumes O
of O
information O
. O

In O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
operation O
, O
it O
uses O
publicly B-TOOL
available I-TOOL
tools E-TOOL
, O
including O
Mimikatz S-TOOL
( O
Hacktool.Mimikatz S-TOOL
) O
and O
an O
open-source O
tool O
that O
exploits O
a O
known O
Windows S-OS
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerability O
( O
CVE-2016-0051 S-VULID
) O
on O
unpatched O
computers O
. O

Like O
Vcrodat S-MAL
, O
Nibatad S-MAL
is O
also O
a O
loader O
that O
leverages O
search O
order O
hijacking S-ACT
, O
and O
downloads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Why O
Whitefly S-APT
uses O
these O
two O
different O
loaders S-TOOL
in O
some O
of O
its O
attacks S-ACT
remains O
unknown O
. O

While O
Vcrodat S-MAL
is O
delivered O
via O
the O
malicious O
dropper S-TOOL
, O
we O
have O
yet O
to O
discover O
how O
Nibatad S-MAL
is O
delivered O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O

Between O

However O
, O
in O
September S-TIME
last O

our O

CSIS S-SECTEAM
published O
a O
blog O
detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-MAL
variant E-MAL
affecting O
one O
of O

customers S-IDTY
. O

Alternatively O
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
APT41 S-APT
injected B-ACT
malicious I-ACT
code E-ACT
into O
the O
package O
prior O
to O
compilation O
, O
circumventing S-ACT
the O
need O
to O
steal S-ACT
the O
code-signing O

and O
compile O
it O
on O
their O
own O
. O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
APT41 S-APT
leveraged O
TeamViewer S-TOOL
to O
transfer B-ACT
malware E-ACT
into O
the O
compromised O
environment O
, O
although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
direct O
evidence O
of O
APT41 S-APT

APT41 S-APT
has O

transactions E-ACT
and O
real O
money O

In O
some O
instances O
, O
APT41 S-APT
leveraged O
POISONPLUG S-MAL
as O
a O
first-stage O
backdoor O
to O
deploy S-ACT
the O
HIGHNOON S-MAL
backdoor O
in O
the O
targeted O

In O
another O

, O
APT41 S-APT
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O

of O
Chinese O

, O
suggesting O
the O

At O

however O
, O

The O

has O
stolen B-ACT
gigabytes E-ACT

, O
mostly O
from O

They S-APT
seem O
to O

Group-IB S-SECTEAM
specialists O
have O

that O
the O

launch S-ACT
the O
second O

of O
Silence’s S-APT

APT10 S-APT

to O
employ S-ACT

that O
aims O

confuse S-ACT
the O

by O
posing O

If O
the O

had O
succeeded O
, O
it O
would O
have O
given O
hackers S-APT
control B-ACT
over E-ACT
the O
