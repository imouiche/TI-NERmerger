# TI-NERmergerV1 and TI-NERmergerV2
Paper title **TI-NERmerger: Semi-automated Framework for Integrating NER Datasets in Cybersecurity**

- We recommend reading the paper and the case study in Section 5 to understand the full functionality of the framework. Also, cite the paper if you use any part of our framework or the curated datasets.

- Sample datasets 1 and 2 are provided for testing before applying the tool to large datasets (eg. dnrti, aptner).

- Run the code as follows:
 
**python TI-NERmerger.py BIOES dataset1.txt dataset2.txt merged_datasets.txt**

**python TI-NERmergerV2.py BIOES dataset1.txt dataset2.txt merged_datasets.txt**
  
This means the user wants to merge dataset1 and dataset2 into a single NER dataset called merged_datasets using BIOES tagging.

- We will provide a video presentation, including code execution, to facilitate comprehension.
